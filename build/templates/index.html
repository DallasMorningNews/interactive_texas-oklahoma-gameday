        <p>Head coach Charlie Strong makes an impact as the team’s defensive play-caller. Strong demoted defensive coordinator Vance Bedford after the team surrendered 99 points in its last two games. Texas can score in a hurry, averaging over 40 points per game so far in 2016. But it will need its defense to slow down a high-powered Oklahoma attack on Saturday.</p>

        <p>This game has all the makings of a shootout, which doesn’t give either team an advantage. However, we saw what happens when Oklahoma’s secondary doesn’t play well against high-octane offenses — TCU scored 21 and 28 points in the first and fourth quarters a week ago, respectively. If the Sooners can contain Texas on either the ground or through the air, it won’t be hard to simply outscore the Longhorns.</p>

        <div class="four-key clearfix">
            <p><span class="keyNumber">1</span><strong>Who contains the pass? </strong> Both teams struggle against the pass, with Texas giving up 12 passing touchdowns and Oklahoma surrendering 13. Sooners junior quarterback has been a force this season and will continue to challenge the Longhorns’ struggling secondary. He already has 11 total touchdowns — nine through the air — this season. For Texas, freshman quarterback Shane Buechele burst onto the scene with eight touchdowns in just four career starts. Whichever team finds a way to slow down the opposing quarterback should have have a serious advantage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="four-key clearfix">
            <p><span class="keyNumber">2</span><strong>Can either team force a turnover? </strong>Similar to each team’s issues stopping opposing quarterbacks, neither team has been able to turn opposing offenses over. The Longhorns have forced just one turnover — ranking last in the Big 12 — while the Sooners haven’t been much better with two takeaways. Going back to 2004, the team that won the turnover battle won the Red River Showdown. And with two struggling defenses, that trend will likely continue on Saturday.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="four-key clearfix">
            <p><span class="keyNumber">3</span><strong>Can Buechele stay composed? </strong>Buechele enters his first Red River Showdown coming off a hot start to his Longhorn career. The freshman looked looked poise in his first two road games, but the split crowd at the Cotton Bowl presents a different challenge. With two fanbases taking up 92,000 seats, the stadium will remain loud from start to finish. Buechele must keep his emotions in check for Texas to have to a chance to pull of the upset. Mayfield, on the other hand, enters his second Texas-Oklahoma matchup. He looks to rebound from a 211-yard, one-touchdown performance en route to his only regular season loss last year.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="four-key clearfix">
            <p><span class="keyNumber">4</span><strong>Sooners must stop ‘18-wheeler’ </strong>Oklahoma failed to contain Texas quarterback Tyrone Swoopes in his short yardage package last season. The 6–4, 249-pound senior played a key role with two scores, including a game-sealing two-yard touchdown pass. The Longhorns have features Swoopes in short yardage again this season — he already has three rushing touchdowns and averages 3.3 yards on third and two-or-less to go. The Sooners must find a way to hold Swoopes in check when he enters the game.</p>

                    <p class="know">The Sooners have perhaps the best tandem of running backs in the country — junior Samaje Perine and sophomore Joe Mixon — but the offensive line hasn’t been nearly as good as it was a year ago. OU lost LG Cody Ford against Ohio State and, as a result, is now starting a former walk-on at center after Jonathan Alvarez slid over to replace Ford. Texas’ defense hasn’t been stellar, but DE/LB Breckyn Hager has shined early in the season, recording 23 total tackles and a tam-high 3.5 tackles for loss. LB Malik Jefferson, the 2016 Big 12 Preseason Defensive Player of the Year, has 23 tackles, as well. Then again, Perine is quickly approaching OU’s career rushing mark for a reason and Mixon averages a Big 12-best 7.7 yards per carry.</p>

                    <p class="know">Offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley transformed the Sooners into one of the nation’s most explosive passing attacks last season. Oklahoma is averaging 6.86 yards per play this season, the most since its 2008 BCS Championship game squad. That has to do with players like QB Baker Mayfield, who is second to only Texas Tech’s Patrick Mahomes in passing efficiency rating (168.11) and averages 266.8 yards through the air per game. Oklahoma’s secret weapon, however, is big sophomore Mark Andrews, who has caught 11 touchdowns on just 30 career receptions, including four this season. Texas’ secondary, which has yet to record an interception this season, might have its hands full if Riley brings an aerial attack to the Cotton Bowl.</p>

                    <p class="know">The Longhorns are without RB Chris Warren (knee) for the next 6-8 weeks, but that shouldn’t slow down the ground game too much. Junior D’Onta Foreman is the Big 12’s leading rusher through five weeks and Oklahoma might have a tough time slowing him down. He ran for 117 yards against the Sooners a year ago and the task of stopping him doesn’t get any easier with DE Matt Dimon out. Beware the “18-Wheeler” — Texas QB Tyrone Swoopes — as well. Failing to stop the Longhorns at the goal line or in short-yardage third-down situations could spell doom for the Sooners.</p>

                    <p class="know">True freshman QB Shane Buechele has been everything he was cracked up to be in the offseason and more. He’s completed 65.5 percent of his passes this season for 959 yards and eight scores. Five different Longhorns receivers have 10 or more catches on the year and six have hauled in a touchdown. Oklahoma’s secondary, which was thrashed at the hands of Houston, Ohio State and in the first and fourth quarters by TCU, could provide the right environment for Buechele to have a breakout game on a national stage if it isn’t careful. Texas may not have an interception this season, but Oklahoma didn’t have one before last week, either.</p>

                    <p class="know">With 242 kick return yards and a touchdown, Oklahoma’s Mixon is perhaps one of the most dangerous special teams threats in the Big 12. He ranks fourth nationally in all-purpose yards, averaging 191.5 per game. In the Red River series, special teams plays have been known to have an effect on the outcome — see Jordan Shipley’s kick return in 2008 or Alex Ross’ in 2014.</p>

                    <p><strong>Baker Mayfield</strong> has had his share of struggles against the Longhorns. The Junior is 0–2 against Texas going back to his days at Texas Tech. But with the Longhorns' defense in flux, Mayfield should have a chance to finally best his burnt orange foe. The Longhorns surrender over 270 passing yards per game and have given up seven passing touchdowns in the last two contests alone. Texas decided to shake up its defense this week. Head coach Charlie Strong announced he will take over the defense from defensive coordinator Vance Bedford, and the team will start three new defensive backs, according to its most-recent depth chart. If Mayfield can take advantage of the chaos surrounding Strong's defense, it could be a long day for Texas faithful.</p>
